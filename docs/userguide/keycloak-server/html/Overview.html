    <p>
        Keycloak is an SSO solution for web apps, mobile and RESTful web services.  It is an authentication server where users
        can centrally login, logout, register, and manage their user accounts.  The Keycloak admin UI can manage roles
        and role mappings for any application secured by Keycloak.  The Keycloak Server can also be used to perform
        social logins via the user's favorite social media site i.e. Google, Facebook, Twitter etc.

        <p>
            The core concept in Keycloak is a <span class="emphasis"><em>Realm</em></span>.  A realm secures and manages security metadata
            for a set of users and registered clients.  Users can be created within a specific realm
            within the Administration console.  Roles (permission types) can be defined at the realm level and you can also
            set up user role mappings to assign these permissions to specific users.
        </p>
        <p>
            A <span class="emphasis"><em>client</em></span> is a service that is secured by a realm. You will often use Client for every Application secured by Keycloak. When a user browses an
            application's web site, the application can redirect the user agent to the Keycloak Server and request a login.
            Once a user is logged in, they can visit any other client (application) managed by the realm and not have to re-enter
            credentials.  This also hold true for logging out.  Roles can also be defined at the client level and
            assigned to specific users.  Depending on the client type, you may also be able to view and manage
            user sessions from the administration console.
        </p>
        <p>
            In admin console there is switch <span class="emphasis"><em>Consent required</em></span> specified when creating/editing client. When on, the client is not immediately granted
            all permissions of the user.  In addition to requesting the login credentials of the user, the Keycloak Server
            will also display a grant page asking the user if it is ok to grant allowed permissions to the client.  The granted consents are saved
            and every user can see his granted consents in Account Management UI and he can also revoke them for particular client. Also admin can see and revoke the grants
            of particular user in Keycloak Admin Console UI.
        </p>

    <div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="d4e54"/>2.2. How Does Security Work in Keycloak?</h2></div></div></div>
        
        <p>
            Keycloak uses <span class="emphasis"><em>access tokens</em></span> to secure web invocations.  Access tokens contains security metadata specifying the
            identity of the user as well as the role mappings for that user.  The format of these tokens is a Keycloak
            extension to the <a class="ulink" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token-14">JSON Web Token</a> specification.  Each realm  has a private and public key pair
            which it uses to digitally sign the access token using the <a class="ulink" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-jose-json-web-signature-19">JSON Web Signature</a> specification.
            Applications can verify the integrity of the digitally signed
            access token using the public key of the realm.  The protocols used to obtain this token is defined by the
            <a class="ulink" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749">OAuth 2.0</a> specification.
        </p>
        <p>
            The interesting thing about using these <span class="emphasis"><em>smart</em></span> access tokens is that applications themselves are completely stateless
            as far as security metadata goes.  All the information they need about the user is contained in the token and there's
            no need for them to store any security metadata locally other than the public key of the realm.
        </p>
        <p>
            Signed access tokens can also be propagated by REST client requests within an <code class="literal">Authorization</code>
            header.  This is great for distributed integration as applications can request a login from a client to obtain
            an access token, then invoke any aggregated REST invocations to other services using that access token.  So,
            you have a distributed security model that is centrally managed, yet does not require a Keycloak Server hit
            per request, only for the initial login.
        </p>
        <div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="d4e65"/>2.2.1. Permission Scopes</h3></div></div></div>
            
            <p>
                Each client is configured with a set of permission scopes.  These are a set
                of roles that a client is allowed to ask permission for.  Access tokens are always
                granted at the request of a specific client.  This also holds true for SSO.  As you visit
                different sites, the application will redirect back to the Keycloak Server via the OAuth 2.0 protocol to obtain an access
                token specific to that application (client).  The role mappings contained within the token are the intersection
                between the set of user role mappings and the permission scope of the client.  So,
                access tokens are tailor made for each client and contain only the information required
                for by them.
